# Aero/Hydrodynamics Coursework
In this repository you will find all of the work that I have compiled in the pursuit of
successfully completing MAE 6226: Aero/Hydrodynamics with Dr. Lorena Barba. The course is
in its second iteration (as of Spring semester 2015) at the George Washington University,
and much of the work you see here is compiled from the notebooks created by Dr. Barba and
her research group. There are, however, large portions of code that I have taken the liberty
of filling in to complete the various assignments requested of me throughout the course.
